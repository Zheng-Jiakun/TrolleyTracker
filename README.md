# TrolleyTracker

### TODO:
1. Implement BLE scanning UUID filter with the SDK library. (Currently use manual comparison only)
2. Handling ESP command error response. 
3. Power optimization (currently there is power mangement function from the library, not sure what it does as did not dive into it for now)
4. FreeRTOS (maybe? as it should run outside the softdevice (BLE protocol stack firmware), may not be a good choice)
5. NFC protocol and write operation.
